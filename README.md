## 🔐 How Payment Flow Works

1. The server applies `x402-express` middleware on the `/authenticate` route.  
2. When a visitor tries to access premium content, they must complete payment through the x402 gateway.  
3. After a successful transaction, they’re redirected to `/video-content`, where the exclusive video is served securely.
